  			<h2>What is this project?</h2>
			<p>The community-tours empower an alternative economy based on trust and sharing.  
We will travel between ecovillages and other sustainable communities across Europe. By bringing spare resources and experts from one community to the next place where they are needed, a new culture of gift-economy is emerging!  
The buses will roll for 6 weeks and all experiences will be documented and published here on this website.  
The concept of the tour can be recreated by anyone, anywhere.  
The goal is to establish a self-running gift-economy network.</p>
